Explanation:
    This program is a game based on Numberphile's Dollar game. The user chooses the number of vertices
    in the game and assigns them a positive or negative dollar amount. The user then chooses the number
    of edges min (V-1) and max V(V-1)/2 (no vertex can have an edge to itself). After the appropriate
    number of vertices and edges are selected the user then chooses their edges, they define which
    vertices will be connected. Once a good game condition is met the User is then allowed to exchange
    dollars by either taking a dollar from each adjacent vertex and giving it to a target vertex or is
    allowed to give 1 dollar from a vertex to each of its adjacent vertices. A game win scenario is set
    when all vertices have a non-negative dollar amount.
